# Pathfinding visualizer

- Visualizing common pathfinding algorithms like dfs, bfs, A\*
- Using mazes generated by the user by clicking on the map, or by maze generation algorithms like recursive division or
  binary tree, with more comming (Prims, Kruskals etc)
- Will add support for better visualizing of weighted graphs later, and add support for other graph algorithms like max
  flow later

How to run the program (assuming you have git and pnpm installed)

```bash
git clone
pnpm install
pnpm run dev

```
